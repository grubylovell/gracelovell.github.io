### RV-12 Light Sport Aircraft Build

At HFC, we are building the first manned airplane at the University of Washington. I am part of a team of over 40 members building the plane using a kit purchased from Vans Aircraft. This project will continue into 2025. After its completion and certification by an FAA inspector, seniors and graduate students will perform capstone research on the interior and user interface.

### Freewing Experimental Aircraft Build

From January to May 2023, I was a member of the Hardware Integration Team for Husky Flying Club's Freewing Drone Build Project. The four-meter experimental drone has front wings that can freely rotate on their axis, giving the drone’s center of gravity mobility along its length. Designed for aerial agricultural fertilization, the drone won the $15,000 first prize in the 2023 Alaska Airlines Environmental Innovation Challenge. I developed proficiency in the following tools to machine and assemble its aluminum frame: vertical drill press, horizontal bandsaw, belt sander, and rivet gun. I also designed and built the foam nose cone using a hot wire bow cutter.

*I was part of the drone build team and not the business team that competed in the challenge.
